<h2 id="homeydashv2">HomeyDash v2</h2>

<p>Second try/version of my dashboard for homey. (Made for a 7 inch android tablet)
Edit the config.json to match your ip adress and bearer token.
Host it on a local webserver (local because of security risks). Open the page in the browser on your android tablet, and add it to the homescreen.
Now you should have a full screen app.</p>

<p>Instead of creating something for others to work out of the box, i am making this dashboard to suit my personal needs.
You are free to use this code, and create your own dashboard. (It&#8217;s not that hard ;) )</p>

<p>NOTE: This is a work in progress. Commits may break the code.</p>
